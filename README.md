![project-banner](https://github.com/TrangNguyenn/Quantium_DataAnalytics/blob/main/Screenshot%202022-06-13%20184728.png)

The program is provided by Quantium to give students an opportunity to act as a Data Analyst at Quantium and participate in some challenging but fun work. Through this experience, students can gain some practical skills such as data validation, data visualisation, statistical testing and more.

The background of the program is that the student is a team member of Quantiumâ€™s retail analytics team and have been approached by your client, the Category Manager for Chips, who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region. The 3 main tasks include:
- **Data preparation and customer analytics**: Conduct analysis on your client's transaction dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations
- **Experimentation and uplift testing**: Extend analysis from task 1 to help identify benchmark stores that allow me to test the impact of trial store layouts on customer sales
- **Analytics and commercial application**: Use the analytics and insights from task 1 and 2 to prepare a report for the client.
